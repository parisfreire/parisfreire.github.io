  description: Galicia Esports is a non-profitable eSports organization that has risen due to the increasing number of players and online competitions since the pandemic started. <br><br>
               After identifying this market gap back in my hometown, I led a remote cross-functional team (graphic designer, devs, event planners and streamers) building online presence through landing websites, tournament utils apps, social media and streaming platforms for finding partnerships, organising events and launching local players into bigger eSports leagues.
