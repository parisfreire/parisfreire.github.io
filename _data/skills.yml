# Skills
- skill: Organizational leadership
  description: I have several years of experience mentoring technical and non-technical people (new joiners, QA, product roles, etc...) about how to apply business logic to technology and viceversa. On the technical side, I have been part of recruitment processes for both backend and frontend roles, so I can lead in any context if I have the required expertise.

- skill: Agile methodologies
  description: Wide experience working with Atlassian tools and different agile methodologies as Scrum, Kanban and Scrumban, adapting them depending on team needs.

- skill: Code versioning and release management
  description: I have been using code versioning tools as Subversion and Git along with branching plugins like Git Flow for some years. This has given me the opportunity to step up and be responsible of release management using CI tools such as Jenkins and Bitbucket Pipelines.
